# LeetCodePrep
- Some Leetcode solutions from my questions practice 
## Remove Duplicate 
- Uses O(1) memory space and a 2 pointer approach to solve question 
## Sol.py 
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II Solution
## Rotate.py
- Rotate index in array by value k (O(n) memeory space, makes use of second array) 
## MoveZereos.py
- used 2 pointer approach, one is non zero, other is zero. swap values, incerement both
## TwoSum.py
- O(n^2) time complexity, 2 pointer approach may also be used here
